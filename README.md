### Made with
- Development kit: [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- IDE: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- Build automation tool: [Maven 3.8.4](https://maven.apache.org/)
- Unit testing: [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- UML diagrams: [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and [Astah UML](https://astah.net/products/astah-uml/)
- Installable packages generator: [jpackage](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html)

### Specification
The project includes:
- initial and final **UML** diagrams
- source code of the **implementation**: game rules, networking, CLI, GUI, additional specifications etc., complete with Javadocs
- source code of the **unit tests**
- a cross-platform **JAR** for executing the application as a server or as a CLI-based or GUI-based client
- documentation for the **communication protocol** and for the two **peer reviews** related to this project.

### Quick run
Download the [final JAR](deliverables/JAR_final/Eriantys-v1.0.0.jar), open a terminal and run `java -jar Eriantys-v1.0.0.jar` with parameters `--server`, `--cli` or `--gui`.

**Important note**: terminals that do not support ANSI will not run the CLI properly.

# Installation
You can run this application through a universal JAR or install it on your device with a platform-specific installer.

## JAR
You can:
- find the [final JAR](deliverables/JAR_final/Eriantys-v1.0.0.jar) in the deliverables folder, or
- fetch the latest cross-platform JAR from the [releases](https://github.com/SimoDedo/ingsw2022-AM46/releases).

The JAR has been tested on Windows, Ubuntu, MacOS and WSL. Download the JAR and place it in the desired folder.

## Installer
Alternatively, you can install the application on Windows or Debian-based Linux distributions by downloading and executing the installer for your platform from the [releases](https://github.com/SimoDedo/ingsw2022-AM46/releases) (double click on Windows, `sudo dpkg -i` on Debian-based Linux). An icon for the application will be automatically added to your desktop.

Note: if you have WSL, it'll still be added to your Windows Start section. If for some reason you can't find the icon, the executable should be in `/opt/eriantys-am46/bin/Eriantys-AM46`.

The installer was made with [jpackage](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/18/docs/specs/man/jpackage.html).

## Requirements
The application requires:
- [Java](https://www.java.com/it/) 17 or higher. You can [download](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) and install version 17 of Java SE or higher. Alternatively you can `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre` on Linux.
- a graphical interface if you want to use the GUI. On WSL for example, you can `sudo apt install libgtk-3-0` (or `sudo apt install openjfx`) and then `export DISPLAY=:0` inside the shell where you'll run the JAR.

## Run
Double-click on the JAR or `java -jar Eriantys-vX.X.X.jar` in a shell (where X.X.X is the downloaded JAR's version) to start the GUI.
Use the parameters `--server` to start the server, `--cli` to start the CLI, or `--gui`/`--client` to start the GUI.

**Important note**: terminals that do not support ANSI will not run the CLI properly.

[Here](https://asciinema.org/a/ahsKxDUVGFGZ4TVQjqK50JV2p) is a quick demonstration of the CLI running in a WSL shell.
